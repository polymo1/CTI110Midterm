      <p>The <a href="https://harnett.k12.nc.us/o/hcec">Harnett County Early College</a> is an advanced school for the <a href="https://harnett.k12.nc.us">Harnett County school district.</a> Students complete standard core high school classes on campus. Students then go to a <a href="https://cccc.edu">Central Carolina Community College</a> location to complete an Associate's Degree.</p>
      <p>I am an HCEC student, starting in the 2022-2023 school year, and as I stand I am a Junior. I am also currently a CCCC student, getting a <a href="https://www.cccc.edu/curriculum/majors/computerinformation/">BSOS (Business Systems and Operations/Operational Support) Associates degree.</a> I like to consider this degree as the "I run the servers" degree.</p>
      <p>I cannot speak for a traditional high school experience, having only attended HCEC as my high school, but I can say my experience at HCEC has been great. My teachers for the most part have been knowledgeable about and engaged with the topics, and more than willing to help. My classmates were great people, and are (again) for the most part just as happy to be there as I was, and willing to help other classmates and I if we got stuck.</p>
