            <p>Programming has always been something I've been interested in. This ties closely in with the love of technology I established in "System Administration", and just as I said there, I've changed from wanting my career in IT from being a Developer to a System Administrator.</p>
            <p>I've time and time again found it hard to learn programming languages. It's not that I don't want to program in languages like C, or Javascript, persay, but I don't want to <b>learn those languages.</b> I only have a functional understanding of HTML and CSS, I can understand mostly but not write stuff like basic Javascript or C.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I think my course of action is taking college classes where I can learn these topics. I learn best by doing, and prefer to have someone explain topics to me when I don't understand instead of watching a video, I think I can learn better. If only CCCC had a C class, rather than a C++ class....</p>
