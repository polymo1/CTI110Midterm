    <p>I've always been interested in technology. I've liked how I could do whatever I wanted essentially, and it was convenient. I once wanted to be a developer when I was a little younger, but I have since then realized I belong in the server rooms, and dealing with already made software.</p>
    <p>Whether it's Windows, Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, or Nix, I've run a few servers in my lifetime. Generally these have been just for messing around with, and held no true value, but they helped me learn. I've learned so much about server administration, and I cannot go back to programming as a main interest.</p>
    <p>I plan to expand my knowledge by continuing practice (I've even got a few VMs created <a href="https://bryie.xyz/u/MWTVGa.png">right now</a>), but also getting education from instructors who are just as passionate about the subject as I am. After all, system administartion is the career I want to be in when I come of working age. It just feels "right".</p>
