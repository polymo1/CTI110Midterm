        <p>I am a member of the SideStore team. <a href="https://sidestore.io">SideStore</a> is an application that allows users of iOS and iPadOS devices to install apps that are not in the App Store onto their device. The team has many very smart individuals, and the community is engaging.</p>
        <p>Alot of my friends have actually come from the SideStore team. They have helped me learn more about the topic of sideloading, programming, and general advanced technology topics, despite my lack of ability to obtain actual server hardware.</p>
        <p>SideStore is also <a href="https://github.com/sidestore/sidestore">open source</a>! This means that anyone can go in and see, modify, or use the code (albeit with certain limitations defined in the license and developer agreement). The project is actually a fork (a copy in a certain point of time) of another sideloading app's source, named <a href="https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore">AltStore</a></p>
        <p>The main selling point of SideStore is that past installation, you shouldn't need a computer (unlike AltStore), but SideStore is also a very beta application, and can experience issues frequently.</p>
